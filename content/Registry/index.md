Hola!!

We're getting married, and we're excited to share our wedding registry with you! No pressure, but if you're into making our newlywed life a bit sweeter, [Check it out](https://www.amazon.ca/wedding/share/derek-step) .

From everyday essentials to fun stuff, we've rounded up a mix of things we'd love. It's like window shopping but with a bonus of knowing you helped deck out our new digs.

Feel free to pick something that speaks to you, and know that your thoughtfulness won't go unnoticed. Can't wait to celebrate with you allâ€”thanks a million for being part of our big day!

Cheers,
Stephanie and Derek
